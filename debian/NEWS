openttd (1.8.0-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    Historically, OpenTTD used the ICU library to provide support for
    non-Western languages, such as Chinese, Japanese, Arabic and Hebrew.
    Since ICU 58, some of the required parts for layouting these languages
    were removed from that library. A replacement using the Harfbuzz library
    was in place for a few versions, but this was not well maintained and
    was a fuss to build Debian packages for.

    Since OpenTTD 1.8.0-2, the ICU library is no longer used for layouting
    and OpenTTD falls back to a very basic implementation of its own. For
    Chinese and Japanese, the result should be usable, though line-wrapping
    might not be perfect. For Arabic, no proper context-aware glyph-shaping
    happens. For Hebrew and Arabic, text is rendered reversed
    (left-to-right, rather the right-to-left), making these languages pretty
    much unusable for now.

    Hopefully OpenTTD can provide a better solution of its own (possibly
    using some parts of ICU or the Harfbuzz library) in the future. Until
    that happens, not all languages are completely supported anymore.

openttd (1.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    Since version 1.4.0-1, openttd has support for using XDG data and config
    directories.

    Short version: If ~/.openttd/openttd.cfg exists, ~/.openttd/ will be used
    for configuration and data files. Otherwise (so for new installations),
    ~/.config/openttd is used for configuration and ~/.local/share/openttd for
    data files.

    Longer version: ~/.local/share/openttd and ~/.openttd (among others) are
    always included in the search path for data files (ais, newgrfs, basesets,
    etc). Data files in those locations are always available in the game
    (except for downloaded content, which is only loaded from the directory
    where it would be written).

    Where openttd writes its data files (downloaded content, (crash) log
    files, screenshots, savegames, config files) depends on where it found
    your openttd.cfg file. If ~/.openttd/openttd.cfg exists, data and config
    files will be written under ~/.openttd/. If ~/.config/openttd/openttd.cfg
    exists, data files will be written under ~/.local/share/openttd/ and
    config files will be under ~/.config/openttd/.

    In reality, things are even a little more complicated, but unless you do
    unlikely things like put an openttd.cfg in /usr/share/games/openttd, the
    above should apply as-is.

openttd (1.0.0~rc3-2) unstable; urgency=low

    The openttd package has been moved from contrib into main. Since the
    OpenGFX free graphics set has been packaged for Debian, one can now run
    OpenTTD without needing any of the resources from the original game
    (though the original resources are still supported).

openttd (0.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

    Handling of AI players has changed in 0.7.0. This package no longer
    contains any AI players, so playing against the computer is not possible
    out of the box any longer. However, you can easily download AI players
    through the new "Content Downloading Service", after which playing with
    computer players is possible.

    Loading old savegames with computer players is supported (AI players will
    be converted according to the current AI settings), but at this moment
    there are no AIs that completely handle any existing infrastructure built
    by the old AI, so starting a new game might be more fun (especially since
    most of the new AIs are a lot less erratic).
